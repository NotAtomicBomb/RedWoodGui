Umm
Ever wanted just one type of Item for each rarity?
Then this mod is perfect for you.

This mod turn all your lame items of one Rarity, to your most loved one (No guarantee, based on current amount) of the same Rarity.

All you have to achieve this is to press the O key, and Bam all your items turned into one Mega Item.

Thank you Felixire for making the base mod.
I just ported it over to Bep for convenience.
